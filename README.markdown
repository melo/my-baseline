My Baseline
===========

This is my system for setting up a baseline system.

It includes most of the stuff I use on my projects.

Usually I have an account for each project baseline to keep them
totally separate.


TODO
====

 * add support for SHA1/MD5 verification of downloads;
 * each package will be installed in a subdirectory: bin/ will be filled
   with symblinks;
 * convert Apache and mod_perl compile scripts;
 * convert dbj-ware stuff.


Included Software
=================

The following software packages are included on my baseline:

 * perl5;
 * libxml2;
 * ruby.


Final notes
===========

Yes, a lot of could probably be done with apt-get, or rpm.

I did it anyway because I understand this system and it works for me
exactly as I wanted.

So sue me.
