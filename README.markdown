My Baseline
===========

This is my system for setting up a baseline system.

It includes most of the stuff I use on my projects.

Usually I have an account for each project baseline to keep them totally separate.


Included Software
=================

The following software packages are included on my baseline:

 * perl5;
 * apache2;
 * mod_perl2;
 * libxml2.



Final notes
===========

Yes, a lot of could probably be done with apt-get, or rpm.

I did it anyway because I understand this system and it works for me
exactly as I wanted.

So sue me.
